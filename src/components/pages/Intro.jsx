                <p>I embarked on my coding journey in 2020, despite being a computer application student, much of my
                    knowledge has been self-acquired, and along the way, I've crafted diverse web applications, including
                    full-stack applications, frontend design, and computer programming.</p>
                <p>Currently, in 2024, I'm expanding my skills to include Vector design and Figma Graphics. Simultaneously,
                    I am pursuing a master's program at Sikkim University, having graduated from NBBGC Tadong Gangtok in the
                    year 2023.</p>
